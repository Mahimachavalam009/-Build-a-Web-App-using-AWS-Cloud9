# A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) pipeline 
is a key tool to automate the steps from development (i.e. created by developers) to deployment (i.e. published to users), which help software get built and released even faster.

In the first project of this series, you'll learn the basics of building a web app using AWS and another tool called VSCode. This will lay the foundation for your DevOps work for the rest of this series!

# Basic outline of steps :

3) ☕️ Install Maven and Java and generate a basic web app.
